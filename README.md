# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple **rule-based chatbot** built in Python.  
It uses **input/output loops** and **if-elif-else conditions** to simulate a conversation.  
The chatbot can answer basic queries, greet users, and respond to keywords.  

This task is part of a **Python Developer Internship Assignment (Task 8)**.
